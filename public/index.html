        <h1>Greetings Professor, I'm Vicky</h1>
        <p>Allow me to introduce myself formally: I am Vicky Das., a graduate student currently pursuing my studies with a strong passion for technology and innovation. I've had the privilege of delving into various aspects of information technology throughout my academic and professional journey, which I believe has provided me with a diverse skill set and a broad perspective on the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

        <p><span class="fun-fact">Fun fact:</span> I dreaded Java since my bachelors turns out I started to like it after taking an Android course here at IIT.</p>

        <p>Let me tell you about my academic journey, which has been nothing short of an adventure. It all began with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in 2017 in Mumbai, India. After that, I earned a Master Degree in Information Technology in 2021. On August 2022, I came to the US to pursue my second Master's Degree in Information Technology & Management from IIT.</p>

        <p>I also have over 4 years of work experience. During my stint as a Senior Software Engineer at a Service Based company, I juggled multiple roles. I started working as a RPA Developer, worked on a tool called UiPath, which I used to automate repetitive & mundane tasks for various companies. After a few years, I learned Javascript, along with JS I learned React & Node.js and loved every second working with it. I even combined RPA with Full Stack tech. Last one year, I led and mentored a stellar team at RPA space. Oh, and by the way, I wear my certifications proudly, including UiPath's Advanced RPA Developer and Automation Anywhere.</p>
        
        <p><span class="fun-fact">Here's an exciting tidbit:</span> had the honor of spearheading a project where we eliminated a staggering 70% of repetitive tasks within the organization using UiPath. It's undoubtedly one of the proudest moments in my professional career.</p>

        <p>In a nutshell, I'm a tech-loving grad student with an insatiable appetite for all things digital. I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in tech.</p>
